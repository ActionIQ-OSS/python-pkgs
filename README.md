# python-pks

These are python packages that we host in order to ensure a consistent environment.
Otherwise source distributions get built each time with potentially different tools / libraries.
The files are hosted by [GitHub Pages](http://actioniq.github.io/python-pkgs/).

Note we use [pyenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv) in this repository.
